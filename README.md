## Group Exercise: Identifying Waste in an IT Organization (Lean Thinking)

**Objective:**  
Work in groups to identify types of waste that can arise in IT or software projects, using Lean principles from manufacturing as a foundation.

**Instructions:**
1. Form into groups. Each group will be assigned one or more types of waste.  
2. Discuss how the assigned waste manifests in IT organizations.  
3. Brainstorm examples from development, infrastructure, or team collaboration.  
4. Prepare a short presentation covering:
   - The type of waste
   - Example(s) from IT
   - Suggestions for reducing the waste

Assign a *scribe* to take notes and a *presenter* to deliver your findings.

You have 15 minutes to discuss and 5 minutes to prepare a 2-minute presentation.

**Examples of Wastes in Manufacturing and IT:**

- **Overproduction**  
  *Manufacturing:* Producing more goods than needed.  
  *IT:* Building unused features or overly complex systems no one asked for.

- **Waiting**  
  *Manufacturing:* Idle time waiting for the next production step.  
  *IT:* Developers waiting for code reviews, approvals, or environments to be ready.

- **Transport**  
  *Manufacturing:* Moving products inefficiently.  
  *IT:* Handoffs between teams causing delays or misunderstandings.

- **Extra Processing**  
  *Manufacturing:* Unnecessary steps, like over-polishing a part.  
  *IT:* Overengineering solutions beyond customer needs.

- **Inventory**  
  *Manufacturing:* Excess materials waiting in storage.  
  *IT:* Unused backlog items, unfinished features accumulating technical debt.

- **Motion**  
  *Manufacturing:* Workers walking long distances unnecessarily.  
  *IT:* Context switching between many tasks or tools causing productivity loss.

- **Defects**  
  *Manufacturing:* Producing faulty products requiring rework.  
  *IT:* Bugs in production requiring urgent patches and rollbacks.
