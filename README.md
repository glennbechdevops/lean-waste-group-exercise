# Group Exercise: Identifying Waste in an IT Organization (Lean Thinking)

## Objective:
Work in groups to identify types of waste that could arise in IT or software projects, using Lean principles from manufacturing as a basis. Each group will be assigned one or more waste categories and discuss relevant analogies in IT.

## Instructions:
1. **Form groups** and receive your assigned waste category (or categories).
2. **Discuss** how the assigned waste might manifest in an IT organization.
3. **Brainstorm** examples of waste in processes such as development, infrastructure, or team collaboration.
4. **Present** your findings to the class, including:
   - The type of waste.
   - Example(s) from IT.
   - Suggestions for reducing the waste.
   
### Example of Wastes in Manufacturing:

1. **Overproduction**: Producing more goods than needed, leading to excessive inventory or unsold stock.
2. **Waiting**: Idle time when machines or workers are waiting for the next step in the production line.
3. **Transport**: Moving products or materials inefficiently across the factory floor.
4. **Extra Processing**: Performing unnecessary steps, such as polishing a part beyond the required specifications.
5. **Inventory**: Excess materials or products stored, waiting to be used or sold.
6. **Motion**: Workers walking long distances to retrieve tools or materials.
7. **Defects**: Producing items that don't meet quality standards, requiring rework or disposal.

## Your Task:
Find analogies for these types of waste in IT projects. How does overproduction or waiting happen in software development, for instance? Discuss ways to reduce these inefficiencies.
