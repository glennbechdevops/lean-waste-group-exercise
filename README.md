## Group Exercise: Identifying Waste in an IT Organization (Lean Thinking)

**Objective:**  
Work in groups to identify types of waste that can arise in IT or software projects, using Lean principles from manufacturing as a foundation.

**Instructions:**
1. Form into groups. Each group will be assigned one or more types of waste.  
2. Discuss how the assigned waste manifests in IT organizations.  
3. Brainstorm examples from development, infrastructure, or team collaboration.  
4. Prepare a short presentation covering:
   - The type of waste
   - Example(s) from IT
   - Suggestions for reducing the waste

Assign a *scribe* to take notes and a *presenter* to deliver your findings.

You have 15 minutes to discuss and 5 minutes to prepare a 2-minute presentation.
